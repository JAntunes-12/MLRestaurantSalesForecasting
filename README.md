# MLRestaurantSalesForecasting
Python code for the generation and testing of machine learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer recurrent neural network model. Several Jupyter Notebook files are available with different test suites to cover feature testing, model tuning, one-day forecast tests, and one-week forecast tests. Also included are three datasets. An actual sales dataset and two derivative datasets made from daily and weekly sales differencing.

To render the Jupyter Notebook pages reliably without dowloading, copy and paste the URL for this repository at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/
The files will be rendered for quick view.
